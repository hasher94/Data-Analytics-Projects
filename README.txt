These are a couple of the data analytics projects i have worked on over the past year.
The NYC high school analytics project involves an end to end journey of the data analytics process from collecting, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing the data.
The purpose of each project was to enhance skills in that domain (Kickstarter database project involves the use of SQLite to build a database from publicly available datasets in order to perform further analysis.)
